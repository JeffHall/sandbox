# Sandbox

Really just a sandbox, not a whole lot more than that.

But also provides a proof-of-concept for: https://vulcan.atlassian.net/browse/IUU-9964

For any Git project that wants to import THIS project, add this line to requirements.txt in THAT project:

``` bash
git+https://github.com/JeffHall/sandbox
```
